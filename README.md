# ðŸ›’ E-commerce Data Visualization AI Agent

This project builds an **AI-powered agent** capable of answering natural language questions related to e-commerce sales data. It can process queries like:

- "What is my total sales?"
- "Which product had the highest CPC?"
- "Calculate the RoAS (Return on Ad Spend)"

â€¦and return human-readable answers, SQL queries, and even visualizations!

## ðŸ“Š Datasets Used

We used the following datasets provided:

1. **Product-Level Eligibility Table**
2. **Product-Level Ad Sales and Metrics**
3. **Product-Level Total Sales and Metrics**

All datasets were cleaned, normalized, and imported into a MySQL database.

## ðŸ§  AI Agent Workflow

1. **User Input**: A question is asked via API or Streamlit frontend.
2. **Query Generation**: Gemini API converts the question into an SQL query.
3. **SQL Execution**: The query is executed on the MySQL database.
4. **Answer Generation**: The result is formatted and optionally visualized.
5. **Response**: Final answer (text + optional chart) is returned.
